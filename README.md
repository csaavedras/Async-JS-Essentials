# Asynchronous JavaScript: Concepts and Practice

## Introduction
Welcome to the "Asynchronous JavaScript: Concepts and Practice" repository. This repository contains a collection of exercises, notes, and examples that I have compiled while learning about asynchronous programming in JavaScript. The goal is to provide a clear and structured resource for developers to understand and apply asynchronous concepts effectively.

## Asynchronous JavaScript Concepts
### Callbacks
A callback is a function passed into another function as an argument to be executed later. This is a foundational concept in asynchronous programming.

```javascript
// Example of a basic callback function
function greet(name, callback) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
    callback();
}

// Callback function
function sayGoodbye() {
    console.log("Goodbye!");
}

// Calling the greet function with a callback
greet("John", sayGoodbye);
```

### Promises
A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks.

### Async/Await
Async/Await is syntactic sugar built on top of Promises, providing a more readable and straightforward way to write asynchronous code.
